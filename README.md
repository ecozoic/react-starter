[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ecozoic/react-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ecozoic/react-starter) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/ecozoic/react-starter.svg)](https://david-dm.org/ecozoic/react-starter) [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/ecozoic/react-starter/dev-status.png)](https://david-dm.org/ecozoic/react-starter?type=dev)

This project is a scaffold to start new react+redux projects powered by Webpack.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ecozoic/react-starter
cd react-starter
yarn
```

## Development
```
yarn start
```

This will start up a webpack-dev-server with hot module replacement and redux-devtools at http://localhost:8080 and a Nodemon-monitored and debuggable (via Node's ```--inspect``` flag) Koa server at http://localhost:3000. 
The webpack-dev-server is configured to proxy HTTP calls to /api/* routes to the Koa server.

## Production
```
yarn build
yarn serve
```

This will generate minified assets in the /dist/ directory and serve them up using a Koa HTTP server at http://localhost:8080. 
This production-ready server supports HTTP caching, etags, and conditional GET requests. 
A visualization of the webpack build will be produced in the /webpack/stats directory. 

## Tests
```
yarn test
```

This will execute Jest unit tests and generate Istanbul coverage reports for both the client and server.

To run Nightwatch e2e tests, ensure the app is running with either ```yarn start``` or ```yarn serve``` and then run:
```
yarn e2e
```

To develop using TDD (Jest in ```--watch``` mode), run:
```
yarn tdd
```
This command will start the webpack-dev-server, Koa server and Jest. Note that the TDD scripts do not generate coverage reports.

## Documentation
```
yarn docs
```

This will generate jsdoc documentation.

## Flow
```
yarn flow
```

This will execute static type-checking with flow.

## Storybook
```
yarn storybook
```

This will start a Storybook server to play around with stories for new components

## Configuration
You can add environment specific configuration settings by creating a .env file in the root directory. .env.sample shows an example format. 
This file will be loaded by dotenv for both the client and server processes. 
You can expose these values to your Webpack build by using the DefinePlugin in webpack.common.js.
