This project is a scaffold to start new react+redux projects powered by Webpack.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ecozoic/react-starter
cd react-starter
yarn
```

## Development
```
yarn start
```

This will start up a webpack-dev-server with hot module replacement and redux-devtools.

## Production
```
yarn build
yarn serve
```

This will generate minified assets in the dist directory and serve them up using a simple Koa server.

## Tests
```
yarn test
```

This will execute Jest unit tests and generate Istanbul coverage reports.

To run Nightwatch e2e tests, ensure the app is running with either ```yarn start``` or ```yarn serve``` and then run:
```
yarn e2e
```

To develop using TDD (Jest in watch mode), ensure the app is running with ```yarn start``` and then run:
```
yarn tdd
```

## Documentation
```
yarn docs
```

This will generate jsdoc documentation.

## Flow
```
yarn flow
```

This will execute static type-checking with flow.
